# CIS 500 Project 3

The goals of this project are to
* Practice writing and using classes/objects
* Raise an exception
* Write/use overloaded operators

# Instructions

For the most part, you will be re-writing Project 1 as a class instead of a module.  

* This is an _individual_ project.
* You may use/adapt _your_ code from Project 1.
* Follow this GitHub Classroom link (https://classroom.github.com/a/b_bmy7bk), accept the assignment, then clone the resulting repo. 
* Implement the methods in `ldate.py`.
  * Pay attention to which methods are instance methods and which are class methods.
  * Notice that the `to_str` method is now `__str__`
  * There are a few additional methods.


Follow the same workflow as Project 1:
1. Add additional unit tests to `ldate_student_test.py`
2. Implement the `LDate` class in `ldate.py`.
3. Debug until your code passes your tests.
4. Run the instructor's automated tests.
5. If any of the instructor's tests fail, that means your set of tests is incomplete. 
   1. Write a failing test (i.e., figure out what test case you are missing), 
   2. fix your code so the new test case passes, 
   3. Add a reflection to `reflection.txt`. This reflection should describe
      * The test case you overlooked, 
      * Thoughts about how it got overlooked,
      * Steps you will take in the future to avoid a similar mistake.
   4. Repeat step 5 above until your code passes all the instructor tests.

When your code passes all the instructor tests, and you have completed the reflection document, push a commit with the commit message that contains "<em>[Grade Me]</em>".

<b>Important:</b> Your reflection document should contain at least one entry for each time you ran the instructor tests.
